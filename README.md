The Department of Defense sponsored a recent CTF (Capture the Flag) event that attracted 5000 applicants in May 2024. For those of you who don't know, a CTF event is one in which participants compete for a cash prize and bragging rights to be in the top ranks of upcoming and current cybersecurity professionals. The challenges ranged from easy to hard among several cybersecurity categories; this year the featured categories were Web Security, Malware/Reverse Engineering, Forensics, OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), and Networking/Recon.
